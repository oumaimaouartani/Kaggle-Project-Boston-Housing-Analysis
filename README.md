# 🏡 Boston Housing Analysis – Econometrics Project

This repository serves as a pointer to my full data analysis and econometrics project on the **Boston Housing dataset**, hosted on Kaggle.

The project includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Multiple linear regression modeling  
- Statistical inference and interpretation of results  

📊 Developed as part of my coursework in **Econometrics**, this notebook demonstrates both technical and analytical skills in Python using libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, and `scikit-learn`.
