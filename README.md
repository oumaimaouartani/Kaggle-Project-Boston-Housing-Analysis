# Kaggle-Project-Boston-Housing-Analysis
In this project, we analyze the Boston Housing Dataset to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) using various regression techniques. The goal is to understand the relationships between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (MEDV) and derive actionable insights for policymakers or real estate stakeholders.
